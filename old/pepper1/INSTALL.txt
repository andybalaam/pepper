sudo apt-get install antlr python-antlr python-nose g++
git clone https://github.com/andybalaam/pepper.git
cd pepper/src
make quick-test

# Add the pepper/src directory to your PATH

# To run the full system tests, still in the pepper/src dir:
make test  # NOTE: fails if pepper/src is not on the PATH

# Now you can run a program like this:
pepper myprog.pepper
