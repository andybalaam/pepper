- Break into lots of separate files and dirs

- Remove special cases for def_init - it can work just like any method I think

- Move arg_types_and_names into EeyFunction

- Ensure local variables can't hide wider-scope variables with the same
  name, but class members _can_ have the same name as something in scope.

- Overloading at runtime
  + Only one definition of function rendered when called multiple times
  - Multiple calls with different types mean multiple fns rendered, with
    different names
  - More test cases with different and same arg lists

- Overloads on different user-defined types

- Find out why if I call gt3 twice in calculated_type.eeyore it returns the
  same answer each time.

- Line and column number of errors

- Spaces in class bodies
- Checking whether class members are available, and of the right type
- Multiple def_inits in a class must agree on properties

- Enforce not allowed string "_eey_" in any identifier

- Modifying values

- Quoting
