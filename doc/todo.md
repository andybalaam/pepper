# TODO

Future plans for Pepper3 features.

## ~~Test/doc setup~~

Code examples in docs get executed and checked.

## Command line examples

See [command_line.md] - write examples of run, eval and compile.

## Minimal example

Get lexing, parsing, evaluation and compilation of a simple example working.

Includes unit test setup.  System tests are provided by the docs test
(probably).

## Code examples

Basic examples of how to write expressions, functions, and how to use type
specifiers.  Possibly also classes/structs.
